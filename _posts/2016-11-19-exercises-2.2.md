### Exercise 2.2-1:

>Express the function  $$n^3/1000 - 100n^2 - 100n + 3$$ in terms of $$\Theta$$-notation.

For the theta notation, we care only about the order of growth. The term of the
formula that provides the steepest increase in growth is $$n^3/1000$$; thus,
the solution is $$\Theta(n^3)$$.
