### Exercise 2.3-2

> Rewrite the merge procedure so that it does not use sentinels.

{% highlight java linenos %}
    merge(A, p, q, r)
        int[] L = new int[q- p +1];
        int[] R = new int[r-q];
        int i = 0; // index on L
        int j = 0; // index on R
        for k = p to r 
            if (i < L.length) && (j >= R.length || L[i] <= R[j]) 
                A[k] = L[i];
                i++;
            else 
                A[k] = R[j];
                j++;
{% endhighlight %}


### Exercise 2.3-3

> Use mathematical induction to show that when $$n$$ is an exact
power of $$2$$, the solution to the recurrence

$$T(n) = \begin{cases}
            2 & \text{if } n=2,\\
            2 T(n/2) + n & \text{if } n = 2^k \text{ for } k > 1
        \end{cases}
$$

 is $$n \log_2 n$$.

By induction on $$k \geq 1$$, we next show that the property holds for each $$n
= 2^k$$.

For the base case, let $$k = 1$$, and so $$n = 2^k = 2$$. By definition of
$$T(n)$$, we have that $$T(n) = 2$$. Since $$2 \log_2 2 = 2$$, the property
immediately holds.

For the inductive step, consider an arbitrary $$k \geq 1$$ and assume that the
property holds for $$n = 2^k$$; we next show that the same holds for $$n = 2^{k+1}$$. Then, we have that

$$
\begin{align*}
    T(n)    &= 2T(n/2) +n \\
            &= 2T(2^{k+1}/2) + 2^{k+1}\\
            &= 2T(2^k) + 2^{k+1} &\text{(by the inductive hypothesis)}\\
            &= 2(2^k\log_2(2^k)) + 2^{k+1} \\
            &= 2^{k+1} \log_2(2^{k+1}/2) + 2^{k+1}\\
            &= 2^{k+1} (\log_2(2^{k+1}) - \log_2(2)) + 2^{k+1}\\
            &= 2^{k+1} \log_2(2^{k+1})\\
            &= n \log_2 n
\end{align*}
$$

### Exercise 2.3-4

> Write a recurrence relation for the worst-case running time of the recursive version of insertion sort.

Here is the recursive insertion sort procedure. In the following, $$A$$ is an
array of integers and $$0 \leq n < A.length$$ is an index on  the array.

{% highlight java linenos %}
    recInsertionSort(A,n)
        if n > 1
            int key = A[n]
            int j = n-1;
            recInsertionSort(A, j)
            while (j >= 0 && A[j] > key) {
                A[j+1] = A[j]
                j--
            }
            A[j+1] = key
{% endhighlight %}

Hence, when the array contains at most $$1$$ element, we do nothing as the
array is already sorted. Otherwise, we divide the problem into a single smaller
subproblem---that is, sorting the array $$A[0..n-1]$$. It takes time $$T(n-1)$$
to solve this subproblem. To divide the problem, it takes a single instruction
to decrease the value of $$n$$ by $$1$$, hence $$D(n) = \Theta(1)$$. Given a solution to
the subproblem, we obtain a solution to the initial problem by finding the
right place to insert the element $$A[n]$$ into the sorted subarray
$$A[0..n-1]$$. This can be done in the worst-case in time $$C(n) =
\Theta(n)$$. Since $$D(n) + C(n)$$ is a linear combination of $$n$$,
we have that $$D(n) + C(n) = \Theta(n)$$. Thus, we have that

$$
T(n) = \begin{cases}
            \Theta(1) & \text{if n = 1,}\\
            T(n-1) + \Theta(n) & \text{otherwise.}
        \end{cases}
$$


### Exercise 2.3-5

> Write pseudocode for binary search and argue that it runs in $$\Theta(\log n)$$.

In the following, let $$A$$ be a *sorted* array of $$n$$ integers, and let
$$l$$ and $$r$$ be two indices on the array with $$0 \leq r, l < n$$. The
recursive version of the binary search algorithm is as follows, where initially
$$l$$ and $$r$$ are set to $$0$$ and $$n-1$$, respectively.

{% highlight java linenos %}
    binarySearch(A,l, r, v)
        if (r < l)
            return null
        int m = (r + l) >>> 1
        if (A[m] < v)
            return binarySearch(A, l, m-1, v)
        else if (A[m] > v) 
            return binarySearch(A, m+1, r, v)
        return m
{% endhighlight %}

The problem size is given by the number of elements in the array $$A[l..r]$$.
Initially, we have that $$A[l..r] = A$$, and so the size is $$n$$. When $$l >
r$$, the array $$A[l..r]$$ is empty, and so we immediately return *null* in
$$\Theta(1)$$. Otherwise, we compute the index $$m$$ that splits the array
$$A[l..r]$$ into two roughly equal-size subarrays. If $$A[m]$$ is the required
value $$v$$, then we are done and we return the index $$m$$. In the other
cases, we use the value of $$A[m]$$ to split the problem into a subproblem of
size $$n/2$$. Hence, we get the following recurrence relation.

$$
T(n) = \begin{cases}
            \Theta(1) & \text{if n = 0,}\\
            T(n/2) + \Theta(1) & \text{otherwise.}
        \end{cases}
$$

Therefore, the recursion tree for the recurrence $$T(n)$$ is a chain of
$$\Theta(1)$$ of length at most $$\log(n) + 1$$; thus, the algorithm runs in
$$\Theta(\log n)$$.

The iterative version of the same algorithm is as follows.

{% highlight java linenos %}
    binarySearch(A,v)
        l = 0
        r = A.length -1;
        while (l >= r) 
            int m = (l + r) >>> 1
            if (A[m] == v)
                return m
            else if (A[m] < v)
                l = m-1
            else 
                r = m+1
        return null
{% endhighlight %}

### Exercise 2.3-6

> Can we use binary search in the search-phase of insertion sort to improve its
worst-case running-time to $$\Theta(n \log n)$$.

No. Let $$j$$ be an arbitrary iteration of the for-loop in the insertion sort
algorithm. Then, we can find the right position $$p$$ where to insert $$A[j]$$
into the sorted sub-array $$A[1..j-1]$$ in time $$\Theta(\log j)$$. However,
once we have found the position, we have to move all the elements in
$$A[p..j]$$ one position to the right, which takes in the worst-case time
$$\Theta(j)$$. Hence, we do not get an improvement by using binary search over
linear search.

### Exercise 2.3-7

> Describe a $$\Theta(n \log n)$$ algorithm that, given a set $$S$$ of $$n$$
integers and another integer $$x$$, determines whether there exist two elements
in $$S$$ whose sum is exactly $$x$$.

In the following, we model the set $$S$$ using an array of integers $$A$$ of
size $$n$$. Then, the algorithm first sorts the array $$A$$ in $$\Theta(n \log
n)$$. Then, for each index $$1 \leq i \leq n$$ in the sorted array, we use
binary search to look for an index $$j$$ such that $$A[j] = x - A[i]$$, and so
$$x = A[i] + A[j]$$. Because binary search runs in logarithmic time, the whole
algorithm runs in $$\Theta(n \log n)$$.


{% highlight java linenos %}
    biSum(A,x)
        A = mergeSort(A)
        for i=1 to n
            if (binarySearch(A, x - A[i]) != null)
                return true
        return false
{% endhighlight %}
