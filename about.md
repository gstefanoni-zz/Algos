I am currently studying algorithms and data structures from the third edition
of [*Introduction to
Algorithms*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms) by
[Cormen](http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/),
[Leiserson](https://www.csail.mit.edu/user/960),
[Rivest](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/), and
[Stein](http://www.columbia.edu/~cs2035/).

I thought I make my solutions to the exercises available online. 

You can find a Java implementation of the algorithms and datastructure
presented in the solutions at
[github.com/gstefanoni/Algos](https://github.com/gstefanoni/Algos).
